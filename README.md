# computer vision: local feature matching

this is a project from my cs 4476 computer vision class.

my implementation includes three main algorithms:

  1. harris corner detector to detect interest points in an image
  
    (ii) SIFT-like feature description returning 128-dimensional feature vectors
  
    (iii) feature matching based on the nearest neighbor ratios for the features
