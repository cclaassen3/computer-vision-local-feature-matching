# computer vision: local feature matching

this is a project from my cs 4476 computer vision class. since this is school work, i cannot publically post my code, but here is my [project website](https://cclaassen3.github.io/computer-vision-local-feature-matching/) describing how i have implemented the following algorithms.

my implementation includes three main algorithms:

 Â 
  1. **harris corner detector** to detect interest points in an image
  
  2. **SIFT-like feature description** returning 128-dimensional feature vectors
  
  3. **feature matching** based on the nearest neighbor ratios for the features
